# <EMPLOYEE-TRACKER-CMS>

## Description

This project is a simple employee tracker that is built using node.js and SQL. I embarked on this to better my understanding of the aformentioned concepts, and I would say that my goal was accomplished.


## Installation

Simply pull down the code and open it in your IDE of choice. From there, run the program in your terminal. Note, you will have to source the schema and seed the database before using.

## Usage

An example of how this application could be used is tracking information of employees that work for a small business.
